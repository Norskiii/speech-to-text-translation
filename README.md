# Speech-to-text translation
Speech-to-text (STT) translation implimented as a part of a Deep Speaking Avatar Bsc project.

## DeepSpeech
In the baseline version, translation from speech to text is done using an open-source Speech-To-Text engine [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech). 

## Jasper and QuartzNet
[NVIDIA NeMo toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) offers pre-build Jasper and QuartzNet speech recognition models. Both can achieve better word-error-rates when compared to DeepSpeech, so most likely one of them will be used for final model.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.6 or above
2. Pip3

## Setup on Linux
 Run 'setup.sh' to install all needed dependencies and pre-trained models:
 ``` 
   $Â ./setup.sh
   ```

## Usage
* DeepSpeech:

* QuartzNet and Jasper:
