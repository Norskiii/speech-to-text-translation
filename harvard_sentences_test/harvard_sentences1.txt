the birch canoe slid on the smooth planks
glue the sheet to the dark blue background
it's easy to tell the depth of a well
these days a chicken leg is a rare dish
rice is often served in round bowls
the juice of lemons makes fine punch
the box was thrown beside the parked truck
the hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage
four hours of steady work faced us
large size in stockings is hard to sell
